# Homework-of-Neural-Network
Using MLP and LeNet to recognition the MNIST data set.
In MLP,we used different optimizer(SGD/Momuntum/Adam).
In LeNet,we We completely implemented this structure.

We did not use the deep learning framework,for example tensorflow,pytorch,Keras.The main library function used here was numpy.
